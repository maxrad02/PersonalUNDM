# UNDM Website

This is the new site for UNL Dance Marathon. This readme has information on the initial thoughts of the contents of the site and is meant to guide its development. 

## Develop

Hydra was built with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) version 3.3.1, but should support newer versions as well.

Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~
