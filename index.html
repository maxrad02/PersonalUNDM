		<h1>What is Dance Marathon?</h1>
		<p>University of Nebraska-Lincoln Dance Marathon is one of the largest student registered organizations on campus.
			Every year, we recruit students from all over campus to come together and fundraise for the Children’s Hospital in Omaha.
			We host small events on campus and within the Lincoln community to integrate all walks of life into our mission
			 of being one generation fighting for the next. The pinnacle of our year is a 13.1 hour “Dance Marathon”
			 where UNL students and kids who have been treated at Children’s Hospital come together to celebrate the money we
			 have raised and dance the night away. We integrate dancing, live acts such as a children’s talent show, crafts and
			 activities for all ages, and even shaving heads for the kids to give families and children affected to have a day
			 without the worries associated with their numerous stays in the hospital.</p>

		<h1>Why We Dance</h1>
		<p>Children's Miracle Network Dance Marathon was founded by students in 1991 in the memory of Ryan White. Since its
			inception, it has grown to over 100 universities and colleges across the country. All entirely student-run, all
			donating 100% of the funds they raise directly to their local children's hospital, Dance Marathons have become a
			tradition on campus and in the community. Year in and year out- students throw the biggest party of the year for
			the children at their local hospital. They stay on their feet for 12, 24, or even 48 hours in honor of children
			who have been through so much. They dance for those who can't. They do it For the Kids!</p>
