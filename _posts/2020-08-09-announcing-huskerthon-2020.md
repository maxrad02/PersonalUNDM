title: Join UNDM as a Morale Captain
---
University of Nebraska-Lincoln Dance Marathon (UNDM) is one of the largest registered student organizations on campus. We are a generation of college students that work with our peers, campus, and the Lincoln community to help the families affected by pediatric illness or injury. Every year, we strive to raise funds and awareness for children who have been treated at the Children’s Hospital in Omaha.  We are an organization and community of individuals who fight for a cause greater than ourselves.  Our predominant goal is to help these Miracle Families (families of patients at the hospital) by planning and facilitating fun events throughout the year to give them a chance to escape from the doctors, hospitals, and worry they face on a regular basis.  Dance Marathon holds recruitment, fundraising, and special events year-round for members of our organization, students at UNL, and the Miracle Families.  The pinnacle of the year, however, is a 13.1 hour “dance marathon,” known as HuskerThon, held each February.  At this event, Miracle Families, the community, and students celebrate the accomplishments and milestones our organization has achieved, while giving the Miracle Children a day filled with dancing, games, and entertainment acts all catered to them. 

There are still opportunities to join the Dance Marathon community for 2020-2021: Morale Captain applications are now open!  Morale Captains are a crucial aspect of the UNDM organization and culture.  This position acts as a liaison between UNDM and the student body.  They are the “hype people'' present both throughout the school year and at HuskerThon.  This position staffs recruitment booths on campus, works at special events, and performs other various tasks pertinent to Dance Marathon.  Morale Captains bring energy and enthusiasm to get people excited about the event and organization’s work in general.  

- Joining Dance Marathon as a Morale Captain presents many exciting opportunities as a college student.  Here are points to summarize the benefits of applying to be a part of Dance Marathon:
